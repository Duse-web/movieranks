                <h2><strong>#1 WONKA</strong></h2>
                <p>Director: Paul King</p>
                <p>Rating: 9.5</p>

    <div class="ranking-info">
        <p>Wonka (Timothee Chalamet) and the film's other main character, the resilient, resourceful Noodle (Calah Lane)—who becomes his best friend and partner in adventure—are plucky orphans, which automatically renders them sympathetic. Wonka even carries around the last chocolate bar created by his mom, a candy-maker who raised him in the jungle, and stares at it whenever he needs inspiration. (Mama Wonka is played in flashbacks by Sally Hawkins, who's become a good luck charm for big-budget fantasies.) </p>
        <p>The main bad guys are a triumvirate of all-powerful businessmen (Paterson Joseph's Slugworth, Matt Lucas's Prodnose, and Matthew Banton's Fickelgruber) who control the manufacturing and distribution of candy, keep the city's corrupt police force under their thumbs (including the chocoholic chief of police, played by Keegan Michael Key), and have gotten laws passed that make it almost impossible for anybody else to break into the business. The central storyline of young Wonka trying to succeed as a chocolatier.</p>
        <p> Tis a variation of a Horatio Alger-inspired template that often begins with an eager young man from the country stepping off a bus in a big city wearing an old suit and a tattered straw hat and carrying sticker-covered suitcases that get stolen they instant he sets them down.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonka_(film)'>Read More</a></p>

        <p>Davidson hits the stage and talks about doing drugs at thirty. He follows by talking about being messed up on drugs at Aretha Franklin’s funeral, walking up to the family, and saying, “I’m just here to pay my R-E-S-P-E-C-T.” It is followed by some jokes about his mom needing to get laid since she hasn’t had sex since his father passed. You won’t find better openings of a special in the last year than this</p>
        <p>Over the years, Pete Davidson has been thrust into the limelight, whether through his comedy or even more with whom he has dated. His struggles with mental health have seen some highs and lows, but as we see with Turbo Fonzarelli, Davidson utilizes his struggles to deliver jokes on the stage. We’ve entered an era where people are quick to cancel folks for things comedians joke about on stage. We saw it recently with Matt Rife’s Natural Selection special, where he pushed the boundaries a little to show that he isn’t just the “crowd work guy.” Of course, more recently Dave Chapelle’s The Dreamer special ruffled feathers (again). People are in a hurry to watch the specials and send detailed reports about the things they said that might “offend.” Davidson doesn’t shy away from his typical dark humor that will undoubtedly ruffle people’s feathers. </p>
         <p>For me, this was some of the best work we’ve seen from Davidson on the stage. His hilarious take on his mother needing to get laid to the Make-A-Wish joke (that was TOP-TIER). But what stood out the most in the special was Pete Davidson, the storyteller.  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davidson'>Read More</a></p>
